# OACE Framework

Welcome to the OACE (Objective-based Autonomous Cognitive Entity) Framework repository. This project is dedicated to the development and implementation of the OACE Framework, a propostion for the creation of digital autonomous cognitive entities â€“ AI that can navigate all the complexities of the world just as a human can. Humanoid Software!

For an in-depth look at the current practical application, please refer to the Mirko.ai project, which is an applied version of what the OACE Framework proposes with the use case of AI Software Engineering. Explore the project and its repository for more insights: [Mirko.ai on GitHub](https://github.com/markokraemer/mirko.ai/).
